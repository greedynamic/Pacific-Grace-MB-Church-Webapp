This webapp is created for Port Moody Pacific Grace MB Church

## Issues Addressed By This Project
The customer currently has a dated website that they use for their church, Port Moody Pacific Grace MB Church.

They stated various problems regarding the ineffective website design. The website lacks a modern design, usability, and good content and element distribution. The website has a generic old-fashioned design that displays little visual appeal. Moreover, they have long lists to hold data. For example, to view the audio recordings, they have a long list that impairs visual clarity and navigation. Furthermore, looking specifically at the home page, it presents a messy layout cluttered with elements such as hyperlinks, text, events post, and a facebook api. Contrarily, looking at the church files and claims form pages, they only show a few text and hyperlinks.
